  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hi, my name is Luisa Miller. I am just finishing my high school education and I am a beginner programmer. This past school year, I had the opportunity to take a Computer Science Principles class and it was a good learning experience.

Throughout the course, I followed tutorials and classroom lessons to build small programs, and I gradually started to understand how code works and what it can create. I also faced many challenges in grasping new coding concepts, but I learned to stay curious and keep experimenting. One of the highlights of my learning experience was working with CodePen, where I enjoyed seeing the visual results of my code and exploring creative design using CSS. From customizing colors and fonts to experimenting with layouts and interactivity, I discovered that I enjoy the visual design aspect of web development. Overall, I am happy that I got to experience this side of science in computer programming and probably look forward to learning more on my own time.</p>
