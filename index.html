  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hi, my name is Luisa Miller. I am just finishing my high school education and I am a beginner programmer. This past school year, I had the opportunity to take a Computer Science Principles class and it was a good learning experience. Most things that I was able to create through programming were through the guidance of tutorial videos or what the teacher was able to show us. But I still have much to learn and grow from here. There were times I was able to understand the world of computer programming and how it works. And there were most times where I struggled in learning new coding concepts. Something that I liked this year in Computer Science was working in CodePen.com. As I wrote out code, I was able to have a visual of what the code made or what it looked like. I really like having the ability to create how the programs were designed in CSS, experimenting with different color pallets, fonts, backgrounds, etc. I was able to practice creating interactive games, apps, and programs. Overall, I am happy that I got to experience this side of science in computer programming and probably look forward to learning more on my own time.</p>
