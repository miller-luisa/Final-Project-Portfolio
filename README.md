# Final Project Portfolio - Luisa Miller

## About Me
Hi, my name is Luisa Miller. I am just finishing my high school education and I am a beginner programmer. 
This past school year, I had the opportunity to take a Computer Science Principles class and it was a good learning experience. 

Throughout the course, I followed tutorials and classroom lessons to build small programs, and I gradually started to understand how code works and what it can create. I also faced many challenges in grasping new coding concepts, but I learned to stay curious and keep experimenting. One of the highlights of my learning experience was working with CodePen, where I enjoyed seeing the visual results of my code and exploring creative design using CSS. From customizing colors and fonts to experimenting with layouts and interactivity, I discovered that I enjoy the visual design aspect of web development.  Overall, I am happy that I got to experience this side of science in computer programming and probably look forward to learning more on my own time.

## About This Project
This portfolio project is the final assignment for my Computer Science Principles class. It showcases several of the projects I‚Äôve worked on this year, highlighting what I‚Äôve learned about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and basic web development concepts. It represents both my progress as a beginner programmer and my interest in creative coding.

# What My Portfolio Includes
My portfolio site includes:

A homepage with a brief introduction about me

A project gallery with links to my work

Descriptions of each project and what I learned while building them

A clean and simple design using custom colors, fonts, and layout

# Featured Projects
## 1. To Do List App
A simple game where users try to guess the correct color from a set of RGB values. This project helped me practice using JavaScript functions and DOM manipulation.

## 2. Real Time Clock and Weather App
An interactive version of the classic game where a user plays against the computer. I learned how to use conditionals, event listeners, and display results dynamically.

## 3. Drum Kit & Tambourine Sound Board
A live digital clock that updates in real-time using JavaScript. This project helped me understand how to work with time, intervals, and dynamically update the DOM.

## 4. Journal Entry Website
A multiple-choice quiz that keeps score and shows results at the end. I practiced using arrays, conditionals, and looping structures in this project.
